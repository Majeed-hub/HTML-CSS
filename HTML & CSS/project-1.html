        Peasemore

        rustic, with
        elegant modern touches. Relax by the cozy log burner perfect for winter evenings or enjoy outdoor seating
        overlooking
        open country fields or in a pretty courtyard filled with flowers in the summer months. A daily menu, all freshly
        prepared in the pub kitchen, includes fresh fish, pies, steaks and chef's daily specials with main course prices
        ranging
        from £11.50 - £19.50. As all dishes are prepared in the pub kitchen, they are able to cater for most dietary
        needs, with
        most sauces, soups and gravy all created gluten free. The Fox also offers gluten free bread and gluten free
        Yorkshire
        puddings on a Sunday.

    "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will
    give
    you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
    master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but
    because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
    Nor
    again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
    occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
    example,
    which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any
    right
    to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain
    that produces no resultant pleasure?"

        <h2>Menu board</h2>
        <h3>main menu</h3>
        Some restaurants – typically fast-food restaurants and cafeteria-style establishments – provide their menu in a large
        poster or display board format up high on the wall or above the service counter. This way, all of the patrons can see
        all of the choices, and the restaurant does not have to provide printed menus. This large format menu may also be set up
        outside (see the next section). The simplest large format menu boards have the menu printed or painted on a large flat
        board. More expensive large format menu boards include boards that have a metal housing, a translucent surface, and a
        backlight (which facilitates the reading of the menu in low light) and boards that have removable numbers for the
        prices. This enables the restaurant to change prices without having to have the board reprinted or repainted.
        
        Some restaurants such as cafes and small eateries use a large chalkboard to display the entire menu. The advantage of
        using a chalkboard is that the menu items and prices can be changed; the downside is that the chalk may be hard to read
        in lower light or glare, and the restaurant has to have a staff member who has attractive, clear handwriting.
        
        A high-tech successor to the chalkboard menu is the 'write-on wipe-off" illuminated sign, using LED technology. The text
        appears in a vibrant color against a black background.
        
       <h2>Outdoor</h2> 
        
        <h3>Menu cards - Presi Corp.</h3>
        Some restaurants provide a copy of their menu outside the restaurant. Fast-food restaurants that have a drive-through or
        walk-up window will often put the entire menu on a board, lit-up sign, or poster outside so that patrons can select
        their meal choices. High-end restaurants  may also provide a copy of their menu outside the restaurant, with the pages of
        the menu placed in a lit-up glass display case; this way, prospective patrons can see if the menu choices are to their
        liking. Also, some mid-level and high-end restaurants may provide a partial indication of their menu listings–the
        "specials"–on a chalkboard displayed outside the restaurant. The chalkboard will typically provide a list of seasonal
        items or dishes that are the specialty of the chef which is only available for a few days.
